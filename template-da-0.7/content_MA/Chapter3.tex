\chapter{Results}\label{ch_results}
In this chapter, the results from the previously described experiments are presented.
Moreover, the indeterministic aspects of the are further investigated for both operation systems. 

\section{Boot Time}
This section mainly shows the possible decrease of the boot time in Linux as there was no need to further improve the start up time of FreeRTOS.

\subsection{Boot Time of FreeRTOS}
The boot time of FreeRTOS has been quantified by formula \ref{eq_t_boot_free}.
As mentioned before, there is no need to optimize the FreeRTOS boot time, so the final $ t_{boot}^{free} $ is 1,1 s.

\subsection{Boot Time of Linux}
The boot time in Linux $ t_{boot}^{linux} $ was 27 seconds when using the initial boot configuration from Xilinx (see \ref{ss_booting_in_linux}). 
The new custom configuration was applied step by step to see the effects on the system:
 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item By changing the file system from \ac{RAM} disk to \ac{UBIFS}, $t_{filesys}$ becomes part of $t_{osload}$ and decreases to ?? s
	\item By further moving the \ac{FPGA} configuration from the \ac{FSBL} to the file system, the total boot time decreases to ?? s 
	\item Finally, the booting is moved from \ac{SD} card to \ac{QSPI} what decreases the boot time to ?? s.
	\item Optionally, the \ac{UBIFS} can be mounted read-only. This further decreases the boot time by 2 seconds, because some start-up checks are skipped in this mode. 
\end{enumerate}

The result of this experiment is a boot time which was decreased by 72 \% in read-write mode and by 80 \% in read-only mode.

\section{Task Switching Results}\label{s_task_switching_results}
The results for task switching show the minimum overhead in a system with at least two tasks for the maximum priority. 
This value is also valid for systems with more real-time tasks of the same priority which use the round robin scheduling algorithm.
For task switching between different priority levels, the scheduling is dependent on the number of priority level.
In such cases, the complete list has to be searched from the beginning.
Therefore, the task switching time is slightly higher than for task switching within the same priority level.
\par
The measurements are presented in two different figures. 
The upper one always shows the time measured on the x axis and the number this time has occurred on the y axis. 
This curve gives a good overview over the statistic and deviation of the measurement.
The lower picture shows the latencies plotted over time. 
This curve shows time dependent events like the timer tick.  
%Further, this presentation of the results is not only valid for the task switching time but for all results presented in the following.

\subsection{Task Switching Results FreeRTOS} \label{ss_task_switching_results_freertos}
\begin{figure}[hbt]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[trim=2.5cm 1.5cm 2.5cm 1.5cm, scale=0.7] 			{inputs/pictures_ch3/task_switching_debug_FreeRTOS_start_end}
	\end{center}
	\caption{Task switching result FreeRTOS} \label{fig_tast_switching_result_free}
\end{figure}
As the red color in figure \ref{fig_tast_switching_result_free} shows, the mean value for FreeRTOS task switching is 238 ns. 
The standard deviation for the test set is 3.8 ns (1.6 \%).
The peaks at the time of 0.1 and 0.2 us are showing the active timer tick. 
The probability to capture the timer tick in this experiment is very high because a large density of the test program code is included into the time measurement.
The maximum value measured for the tick is 1.059 us.
When the task switching time is subtracted from this value, the resulting tick overhead is 821 ns.
The reason for the different tick times (1.059 us and 0.752 us) cannot be clearly verified, as no proper tracing tools were available. 
Yet, some assumptions can be made on the behavior of the system. 
In table \ref{tab_task_switching}, the test algorithm is described. 
Depending on the point in time when the tick interrupts the code execution, the delay time can vary.
When the interrupt occurs before line 2 was executed, a task switch is performed and the time stop in line 3 is executed.
When the code continues to run, a yield is performed in line 5.
After the context switch, Task 1 continues in line 2 and another context switch is performed. 
So actually two context switches are measured. 
Another scenario which is theoretically possible is that the tick interrupts the test program right between line 3 and 4. 
In that case, the tick would not be visible in the graph.
Moreover, the delay can be caused by loading data needed by the \ac{ISR} to the cache.
\par
Further, small spike clusters which cause a jitter of about 35 ns are visible during the complete test.
Those cannot be explained by the test setup of the software, so it seems likely that they are caused by hardware, e.g. the cache mechanism.  
The delays observed in this experiments are also valid for the experiments in the following.
 
\subsection{Task Switching Results LinuxRT} 
The mean value for task switching in LinuxRT is 1.46 us and the standard deviation is 131 ns (9.0 \%).
The higher standard deviation is nicely visible in the upper plot of figure \ref{fig_tast_switching_result_linux}. 
Moreover, the timer tick is clearly recognizable every 10 ms.
Its maximum value is 18.945 us whereas the lower values are pending around 10 us.
Therefore, the maximum tick overhead is 17.485 us.
The reasons for the differences of the tick delay are the same as in FreeRTOS.
Further, LinuxRT executes softirqs after the tick interrupt.
Their number varies from tick to tick and therefore causes different delays. 
As in FreeRTOS, small spike clusters are visible during the complete test.
Because of the higher noise, they do not become as apparent as in the FreeRTOS measurement.

\begin{figure}[htb]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[trim=2.5cm 1.5cm 2.5cm 1.5cm, scale=0.7] 			{inputs/pictures_ch3/task_switching_results_measurements_cfg6_int_saves}
	\end{center}
	\caption{Task switching result LinuxRT} \label{fig_tast_switching_result_linux}
\end{figure}

The mean task switching latency in LinuxRT is 6.1 times higher than in FreeRTOS.
This is mainly due to the implementation of the yield function in both systems.
Whereas the yield function in Linux causes a hierarchy of function calls, the yield in FreeRTOS is implemented as macro.   

\section{Semaphore Results}
This sections summarizes the results for the single mutex latency, the semaphore shuffling time and the event signaling. 
As the plots look very similar to section \ref{s_task_switching_results}, only the resulting values will be presented.
The single semaphore experiment shows the overhead arising when no other task interrupts an execution code secured by semaphores. 
The semaphore shuffling experiment defined by Kar quantifies the semaphore overhead when a second task tries to access data which is locked by a semaphore. 
The last experiment measures the latency which is caused by event synchronization. 
Concretely, this means waking up a task by signaling a binary semaphore in FreeRTOS or a condition variable in Linux.
\par
In time critical applications, the choice of the synchronization method can be crucial.
For example, sometimes the overhead of priority inheritance can be avoided by specific application design.

\subsection{Semaphore Results FreeRTOS}
All semaphore functions in FreeRTOS are based on message queues.
Mutexes support priority inheritance compared to the other kind of semaphores provided in FreeRTOS.
Therefore, the overhead when working with mutexes is slightly higher. 
The results of this measurement are presented in table \ref{tab_results_semaphores_freertos}. 

\begin{table}[htbp]
	\centering
		\begin{tabular}{|l||l|l|l|}
			\hline

		\end{tabular}
	\caption{Results semaphore tests in FreeRTOS}
	\label{tab_results_semaphores_freertos}
\end{table}

As already mentioned, the causes of delays are summarized in section \ref{ss_task_switching_results_freertos}.

\subsection{Semaphore Results LinuxRT}
The Linux implementation of the tests uses the POSIX \ac{API}.
Comparing the mean values (see table \ref{tab_results_semaphores_linux}), the single semaphore test scores as well as the one in FreeRTOS.
Still, the standard deviation is much higher (46 \% compared to 5.9 \%).
The semaphore shuffling time in LinuxRT is 3.3 times higher than in FreeRTOS.
This is mainly caused by two context switches which are part of this experiment (see table \ref{tab_sem_kar}). 
They are caused by the blocking at the mutex of task 2 in line 4 and by the call yield function of task 1 in line 6.
The switch takes about 3 us and therefore almost half of the time. 
Even when considering the task switch time in the experiment, the latency in LinuxRT is still higher than in FreeRTOS.
The same problem arises for the event signaling experiment which contains one context switch.
Here, FreeRTOS is 3.01 times faster than Linux.

			\hline
		\end{tabular}
	\caption{Results semaphore tests in LinuxRT}
	\label{tab_results_semaphores_linux}
\end{table}

\section{Message Passing Time}
Message passing is another mechanism of task synchronization, so it is relevant to consider its performance.
The algorithm (see table \ref{tab_message_passing}) also provides some points where a task switch can cause faulty results.
One possible error is that the execution is interrupt between line 2 and 3.
This causes one task switching delay because task 2 is not schedulable, so task 1 will be rescheduled.
Another error can happen when task 2 is interrupted before blocking on the queue. 
This causes the message to be already available in the queue after task 1 yields the processor. 
Therefore, task 2 does not block but retrieves the message immediately what takes less time than the original procedure.

\subsection{Message Passing in FreeRTOS}
\begin{figure}[htb]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[trim=2.5cm 1.5cm 2.5cm 1.5cm, scale=0.7] 			{inputs/pictures_ch3/message_passing_latency_FreeRTOS_start_end}
	\end{center}
	\caption{Binary semaphore result FreeRTOS} \label{fig_message_passing_free}
\end{figure}
The mean time for passing one message with the content of one byte is 901 ns. 
The standard deviation is 24.9 ns (2.76 \%) and the maximum peak occuring while the timer interrupt is active is 2.531 us.
This makes a total overhead of 1,63 us. 
The plot (figure \ref{fig_message_passing_free}) clearly shows the error cases discussed above.  

\subsection{Message Passing in LinuxRT}
\begin{figure}[htb]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[trim=2.5cm 1.5cm 2.5cm 1.5cm, scale=0.7] 			{inputs/pictures_ch3/message_passing_latency_measurements_cfg6_int_saves}
	\end{center}
	\caption{Condition variable result LinuxRT} \label{fig_message_passing_linux}
\end{figure}

As already mentioned, the SysV \ac{API} was used for this experiment, not the POSIX \ac{API} as it is not supported by the used platform.
The mean time for passing one message in LinuxRT with the content of one byte is 5.135 us (see figure \ref{fig_message_passing_linux}). 
The standard deviation is 268 ns (5.22 \%) and the maximum peak occuring while the timer interrupt is active is 18.657 us.
This makes a total overhead of 13.522 us. 
The mean message passing latency in FreeRTOS is 5.7 times faster than in LinuxRT.

\section{Deadlock Breaking Time}
The detailed algorithm to obtain the deadlock breaking time is described in table \ref{tab_deadlock}.
This time gives an orientation on the time the operation system needs to resolve a priority inversion by the implemented priority inheritance algorithm.
As usually the task with the highest possible priority is running in this experiment, the timer tick only causes an unnecessary context switch which results in the same task being continued.
This experiment has similarities to the semaphore shuffling but also includes the priority inheritence component.

\subsection{Deadlock Breaking Time in FreeRTOS}
\begin{figure}[htb]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[trim=2.5cm 1.5cm 2.5cm 1.5cm, scale=0.7] 			{inputs/pictures_ch3/deadlock_results_FreeRTOS_start_end}
	\end{center}
	\caption{Deadlock breaking time FreeRTOS} \label{fig_deadlock_result_free}
\end{figure}
The mean time for the deadlock breaking time in FreeRTOS is 2.113 us. 
The standard deviation is 34.5 ns (1.63 \%) and the maximum peak occuring while the timer interrupt is active is 3.854 us.
This makes a total overhead of 1,74 us. 

\subsection{Deadlock Breaking Time in LinuxRT}
\begin{figure}[htb]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[trim=2.5cm 1.5cm 2.5cm 1.5cm, scale=0.7] 			{inputs/pictures_ch3/deadlock_results_measurements_cfg6_int_saves}
	\end{center}
	\caption{Deadlock breaking time LinuxRT} \label{fig_deadlock_result_linux}
\end{figure}
The mean time for the deadlock breaking time in FreeRTOS is 20.68 us. 
The standard deviation is 643 ns (3.11 \%) and the maximum peak occuring while the timer interrupt is active is 37.146 us.
This makes a total overhead of 16.466 us.
The LinuxRT implementation is 9.79 times slower than the same implementation in FreeRTOS.
While FreeRTOS seems to switch from task 3 directly to task 1 when the semaphore is taken, LinuxRT still switches to task 2 before switching to task 1.
 
\section{Interrupt Latency} 
The interrupt latency depends not only on the underlying hardware but also on the handling by the operation system.
While the only interrupt which is being handled directly by FreeRTOS is the timer tick, Linux supports more advanced handling of interrupts. 
Therefore, the analysis of the interrupt latency in Linux is more complex (see section \ref{ss_interrupt_latency_results_in_linux}).

\subsection{Interrupt Latency Results in FreeRTOS}
As there is no \ac{OS} overhead in the interrupt handling in FreeRTOS, it is very fast and predictive.
The time to handle the interrupt internally and turn on an \ac{LED} from the \ac{ISR} takes no more than 740 ns (see figure \ref{fig_interrupt_latency_freertos}). 
The mean value is 727.71 ns and the standard deviation 4.775 ns (0.66 \%). 
Even when the \ac{LED} is turned on from a task which is unblocked by the \ac{ISR}, the procedure is only 10 ns slower.  
\begin{figure}[htb]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[scale=0.5] 
		{inputs/pictures_ch3/isr_free}
	\end{center}
	\caption[Interrupt latency FreeRTOS]{Interrupt latency FreeRTOS, resolution: 1 us} \label{fig_interrupt_latency_freertos}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Interrupt Latency Results in Linux}\label{ss_interrupt_latency_results_in_linux}
The interrupt handling in Linux is quiet complex and many different cases have to be considered. 
As already mentioned, the \acp{ISR} in LinuxRT are threaded to reduce interrupt delays for critical tasks. 
Obviously, this increases the total interrupt latency.
To investigate how much the threading influences the interrupt latency, the tests were also run on a standard Linux platform as well.
Further, the tests were also performed under load condition as it is desirable to run standard [Wort?] applications on LinuxRT, not only real-time applications. 
This experiment shows very well the influence of \ac{I/O} bound load on the Linux system.

\subsection{The fastest Interrupt Handling in Linux}
The first test which was performed is very similar to the FreeRTOS test. 
It tests the standard Linux system's interrupt latency.
This means that the interrupts are handled non-threaded and the \ac{LED} is lightened in the \ac{ISR} directly.
The setup was tested on a standard Linux system.
The mean value for 50000 measurements is 1.812 us with a standard deviation of 433.06 ns (22.90 \%). 
This is only 2.5 times higher than in FreeRTOS. 
The maximum measured value is 3.51 us.
When put under stress by a constant SCP transfer, the value increases to a mean value of 2.679 us and a standard deviation of 1.30 us (48.53 \%).
The maximum value rises to 29.5 us.
\par
When the same experiment was repeated for LinuxRT, logically, the results are much higher.
The mean value is 10.027 us with a standard deviation of 987.36 ns. 
The maximum measured value is 17.05 us.
After stressing the system, the mean value stays almost constant at 10.486 us, but the standard deviation rises to 4.496 us (42.88 \%) and the maximum recorded value to 90 us.

\subsection{Interrupt handling and User Processes}
Usually, programmer prefer to write programs in user space and not kernel modules. 
Therefore, in this test a typical user thread scenario is simulated.
A thread is waiting for an interrupt to occur and then issues a write command to turn off an \ac{LED}. 
Both experiments were repeated for mainline Linux and LinuxRT. 
The results were recorded by an oscilloscope.
In the figures (\ref{fig_interrupt_latency_linuxrt} - \ref{fig_interrupt_latency_linux_load}), the upper channel shows the pulse generator which triggers the interrupt.
The lower channel shows the reaction of the \ac{OS}.  

\subsubsection{LinuxRT}

	\end{center}
	\caption[Interrupt latency LinuxRT]{Interrupt latency LinuxRT, resolution 5 us} \label{fig_interrupt_latency_linuxrt}
\end{figure}
The mean value measured for the user task when using LinuxRT is 24.455 us. 
The standard deviation is 3.897 us (115.94 \%). 
In figure \ref{fig_interrupt_latency_linuxrt}, the latencies for the experiment are shown.
Evidently, there is a high jitter although no load was put on the system. 
The maximum latency is at about 41 us. 

\begin{figure}[htb]

	\caption[Interrupt latency LinuxRT with load]{Interrupt latency LinuxRT with load, resolution 15 us} \label{fig_interrupt_latency_linuxrt_load}
\end{figure}
Figure \ref{fig_interrupt_latency_linuxrt_load} shows the same experiment when the system was stressed with network load. 
The mean value for this experiment is 29.375 and the standard deviation is 6.202 us (21.11 \%).
The maximum value here is about 100 us.

\subsubsection{Mainline Linux}
To see how significant the differences between LinuxRT and the mainline kernel are, the same experiment is also repeated using the mainline kernel. 
\par
The mean value measured for the user task is ?? us. 
The standard deviation is ?? us (?? \%). 
In figure \ref{fig_interrupt_latency_linux}, the latencies for the experiment are shown.
The maximum value is at about 29 us.

	\caption{Interrupt latency standard Linux with load} \label{fig_interrupt_latency_linux_load}
\end{figure}
Figure \ref{fig_interrupt_latency_linux_load} shows the same experiment stressed with \ac{I/O} load.  
As in LinuxRT, the maximum registered value is unacceptably large (115 us).
The mean value is at 15.853 us and the standard deviation at 6.850 us (43.2 us \%).

\section{Preemption Time}
The preemption time is related to the interrupt latency, but measures the time that it takes to interrupt a low priority task and then continue a high priority task.
Further, a difference is that the test program does not record the time it takes to communicate with the peripheral devices.
As this situation occurs very often in real-time systems, this is an important measurement [Wort].  
The \ac{GPIO} interrupt is triggered by the interrupt generator every 5 ms.

\subsection{Preemption Time in FreeRTOS}
\begin{figure}[htb]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[trim=2.5cm 1.5cm 2.5cm 1.5cm, scale=0.7] 			{inputs/pictures_ch3/preemption_time_FreeRTOS_start_end}
	\end{center}
	\caption{Preemption result FreeRTOS} \label{fig_preemption_result_free}
\end{figure}

The mean value measured for the preemption time is 2.111 us. 
The standard deviation is 75 us (3.55 \%). 
In figure \ref{fig_preemption_result_free}, the results of the experiment are shown.
The maximum value is 2.626 us. 
Because the results were recorded only every 5 ms, it is likely that one peak in the in the upper plot results from the test being interrupted by the timer tick. 
The other peak is the uninterrupted measurement.

	\caption{Preemption result LinuxRT} \label{fig_preemption_result_linux}
\end{figure}
The mean value measured for the preemption time in LinuxRT is 15.370 us. 
The standard deviation is 9.170 us (59.66 \%). 
In figure \ref{fig_preemption_result_linux}, the results of the experiment are shown.
The maximum value is 109.968 us.
This results in a total maximum overhead of 94.598 us.
