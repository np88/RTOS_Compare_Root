\chapter{Measurements}\label{ch_measurements}
This chapter describes the measurements performed for benchmarking the \acp{OS} FreeRTOS and LinuxRT.
First, the conditions under which the experiments have taken place are described.
This includes hardware platform, time measuring technique and setup of the operation systems under test.
After that every measurement is described in detail beginning with the boot time.

\section{Test Environment}
This section contains a description of the test environment - the hardware platform, the development tools and the configuration of the used \acp{OS}.
\subsection{Hardware Platform}
The underlying hardware platform is a Xilinx ZC702 Evaluation Board \cite{xilinx:zc702_ev_board} with an Zynq-7000 XC7Z020 \cite{xilinx:zynq7000}.
The XC7Z020 chip integrates a \ac{PS} and a \ac{PL} on a single die.
Two ARM Cortex-A9 MPCore application processors running at 666 MHz are located in the \ac{PS}.
Both cores inherit a 32 KB instruction and a 32 KB data level 1 cache.
Moreover, they share a 512 KB level 2 cache and 256 K SRAM.
The \ac{PL} is an Artix-7 from the Xilinx's 7 series FPGA technology and can be used to implement custom hardware designs.
\par
The \ac{PS} uses so called \ac{MIO} pins to connect to peripheral devices.
Those pins can be configured to connect either \acp{GPIO}, Ethernet, \ac{SPI} and others.
The \ac{PL} and the \ac{PS} can be connected using the \ac{EMIO} pins.
Moreover, the \ac{EMIO} pins can be used to extend the number of connected peripherals.
\par
When a tool is developed utilizing the Zynq platform, most likely both \ac{PS} and \ac{PL} will be included.
Therefore, an interrupt generator was implemented in the FPGA design.
