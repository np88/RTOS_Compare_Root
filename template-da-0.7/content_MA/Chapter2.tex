\chapter{Measurements}\label{ch_measurements}
This chapter describes the measurements performed for benchmarking the \acp{OS} FreeRTOS and LinuxRT.
First, the conditions under which the experiments have taken place are described.
This includes hardware platform, time measuring technique and setup of the operation systems under test.
After that every measurement is described in detail beginning with the boot time.

\section{Test Environment}
This section contains a description of the test environment.
The underlying hardware platform is a Xilinx ZC702 Evaluation Board with an Zynq-7000 XC7Z020 (for details refer to \cite{xilinx:zc702_ev_board }).
The XC7Z020 chip integrates a \ac{PS} and a \ac{PL} on a single die.
