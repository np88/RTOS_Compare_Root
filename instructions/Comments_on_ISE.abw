Creating own Board Description file:
The /opt/Xilinx/14.4/ISE_DS/EDK/board/Xilinx/boards/ folder contains folders with xbd files for different boards. To create an own file, have a look at the file structure of e.g. the Xilinx_SP601/data/ folder (14.4). Copy and modify it for your needs. An UCF file can be obtained online and the information for the xbd file can be found online or on the box of the board.
